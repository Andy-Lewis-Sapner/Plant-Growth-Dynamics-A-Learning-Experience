  briefDescription: "Snake plants (Dracaena trifasciata), also known as mother-in-law\u2019s
    tongue, are resilient evergreen perennials with sword-like leaves in green, yellow,
    and cream patterns. They are popular for their ability to thrive in low light
    and go without water for weeks, making them perfect for beginners. Typically
    growing to 0.6\u20131.5 meters tall, snake plants can bloom white, tubular flowers
    in spring."
  growingRecommendations:
  - "Light: Place in bright, indirect light for 8\u201310 hours a day. Can tolerate
    low light but will grow best with some direct sunlight."
  - "Watering: Water when the soil is completely dry. In the warmer months, water
    every 2\u20133 weeks; in winter, water once a month. Overwatering can cause root
    rot."
  - "Humidity: Prefers average humidity levels (30%\u201350%), typical for indoor
    environments."
  - 'Fertilizer: Feed once in spring and once in mid-summer with diluted balanced
    fertilizer. Avoid fertilizing in winter.'
  - "Temperature: Keep between 21\xB0C and 32\xB0C (70\xB0F to 90\xB0F). Protect
    from temperatures below 10\xB0C (50\xB0F) to avoid damage."
