  briefDescription: Elephant ears are tropical perennials prized for their large,
    lush leaves, which create a bold, dramatic effect in gardens and homes. They
    belong to the Colocasia, Alocasia, and Xanthosoma genera and thrive in warm,
    humid environments. These fast-growing plants reach maturity within a single
    season and can be grown indoors or outdoors in the right conditions. However,
    they are toxic to humans and pets if ingested.
  growingRecommendations:
  - 'Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy. Elephant ears thrive
    in wet conditions and can even tolerate shallow standing water. If grown in containers,
    they may need daily watering.'
  - "Temperature: Maintain temperatures of at least 70\xB0F (21\xB0C) during the
    day and 60\xB0F (16\xB0C) at night. These plants are sensitive to cold and will
    not survive frost."
  - 'Humidity: High humidity is essential for elephant ears. If grown indoors, mist
    the leaves regularly or use a humidifier to maintain moisture levels.'
  - 'Fertilizer: Apply a high-nitrogen, water-soluble fertilizer every two to three
    weeks during the growing season to support their large foliage.'
  - 'Light: While they tolerate full sun, elephant ears prefer partial shade or dappled
    light, especially varieties with green leaves. Dark-leaved varieties require
    more sunlight to maintain their color.'
