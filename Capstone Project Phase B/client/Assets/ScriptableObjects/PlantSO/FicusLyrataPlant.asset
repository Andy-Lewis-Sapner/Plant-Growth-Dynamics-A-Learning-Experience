  briefDescription: The fiddle leaf fig is a broadleaf evergreen known for its large,
    glossy, violin-shaped leaves. Despite its reputation for being somewhat finicky,
    it is a popular indoor plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability
    to household conditions. This plant can grow to an impressive height of 6 to
    10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) indoors and up to 50 feet (15 meters) outdoors in its
    native habitat. However, it is toxic to humans and pets if ingested.
  growingRecommendations:
  - 'Light: Requires bright, indirect light for about six hours daily. Avoid direct
    afternoon sun, which can scorch its leaves.'
  - 'Watering: Water when the top inch (2.5 cm) of soil is dry. Overwatering can
    cause root rot, while underwatering leads to wilting. To prevent salt buildup,
    flush the soil with water monthly.'
  - "Temperature & Humidity: Prefers stable temperatures between 60\xB0F and 85\xB0F
    (16\xB0C to 29\xB0C). Keep humidity between 30-65%. If your home is dry, use
    a humidifier or mist occasionally. Avoid placing it near drafts or air conditioning
    vents."
  - 'Soil: Use a well-draining, loamy soil mix. A peat-based soil combined with perlite
    or a 50/50 mix of cactus and houseplant soil works well.'
  - 'Fertilizer: Feed monthly during the growing season with a high-nitrogen fertilizer
    (NPK 16-5-11) to support healthy leaf growth. Liquid or slow-release fertilizers
    work well.'
