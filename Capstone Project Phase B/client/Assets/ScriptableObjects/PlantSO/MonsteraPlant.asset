  briefDescription: Monstera deliciosa, also known as the Swiss cheese plant, is
    a fast-growing tropical vine native to Central America. It is admired for its
    large, glossy, split leaves (fenestrations) and ability to thrive indoors. This
    plant can grow 3 to 15 feet (0.9 to 4.5 meters) tall and 3 to 8 feet (0.9 to
    2.4 meters) wide when mature. Though easy to care for, it is toxic to humans
    and pets if ingested.
  growingRecommendations:
  - "Light: Prefers bright, indirect light (65\xB0F to 75\xB0F / 18\xB0C to 24\xB0C).
    Direct sunlight can scorch leaves; too little light can prevent fenestrations
    from developing. Can tolerate full shade outdoors, growing well in dappled sunlight."
  - "Watering: Water when the top 2 inches (5 cm) of soil are dry. Slowly water until
    it drains out of the pot\u2019s drainage holes. Reduce watering frequency in
    winter. Limp or curling leaves indicate underwatering."
  - "Temperature & Humidity: Thrives in temperatures between 65\xB0F and 85\xB0F
    (18\xB0C to 29\xB0C). Can tolerate temperatures as low as 50\xB0F (10\xB0C) but
    stops growing in extreme cold or heat. Prefers humidity around 60%\u2014increase
    humidity using a humidifier or pebble tray."
  - 'Soil: Requires well-draining, peat-based soil with good aeration. Ideal mix:
    3 parts indoor potting soil, 2 parts shredded bark, 1 part perlite. Prefers acidic
    to neutral soil (pH 5.5 to 7.0).'
  - 'Fertilizer: Feed with a balanced liquid fertilizer (1-1-1 or 3-1-2 ratio) every
    2-4 weeks during the growing season. Reduce fertilization in fall and winter.'
