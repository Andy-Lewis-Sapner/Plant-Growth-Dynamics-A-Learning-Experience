Hello!

Thank you for downloading this 3D model. Before you proceed with rendering, here is a guide for applying the textures:

You will find TWO textures inside the "Textures" folder for the 3D model:

1. "Double-arm street light pole" 4K Texture 
2. "Single-arm street light pole" 4K Texture

Inside each, you may find SIX different texture maps:

- BaseColor = Diffuse map
- Metalness = Metallic
- Roughness
- Normal = Bump map
- Transmission
- Emissive = Emission

**If the textures aren’t added automatically, here’s how to apply them manually:**

Apply the "Double-arm street light pole" texture to the following object:
- "Double_arm"

Apply the "Single-arm street light pole" texture to the following object:
- Road part of "Single_arm"

Thank you once again for downloading. I hope this model meets your needs and expectations. 

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact me.
